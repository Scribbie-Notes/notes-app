# 🎉 Contributing to Scribbie

Thank you for considering contributing to Scribbie! We welcome all contributions, whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new features. To help you get started, we've outlined the process for contributing to the project.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Get Assigned to an Issue

Please make sure you are assigned to a GitHub issue before working on it. This ensures that multiple contributors don't work on the same issue at the same time.

- Explore the open issues in the repository.
- Comment on the issue you'd like to work on.
- Wait for the maintainers to assign the issue to you.

### 2. Fork the Repository

To start contributing:

1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page.
2. Clone your fork locally:

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/notes-app.git
 ```

### 3. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

  ```
  git checkout -b your-branch-name
  ```

Make sure the branch name describes what you're working on, e.g., `fix-typo` or `add-feature`.

### 4. Make Changes and Commit

1. Make the changes you need for the issue.
2. Follow the existing code style and conventions.
3. Write concise and meaningful commit messages:

 ```
 git commit -m "Description of the changes"
 ```

### 5. Test Your Changes

If your contribution affects any functionality, ensure that tests are included and that the existing tests pass.

### 6. Push Your Changes

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 7. Submit a Pull Request

Submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository from your branch. The PR should:

- Include a descriptive title.
- Mention the issue number you are addressing (if applicable).
- Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you've made.
- Attach screenshots / screen recording to show your work.
Your PR will be reviewed, and you may be asked to make additional changes before it is merged.

## 📚 Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the coding standards and guidelines.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Ensure your changes do not introduce breaking bugs.
- Be responsive to feedback and comments from the project maintainers.
- Respect deadlines and guidelines in case you're working as part of a program (e.g., GSSoC).

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you to make Scribbie a better tool!
